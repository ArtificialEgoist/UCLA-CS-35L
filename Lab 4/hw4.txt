The homework starts with checking out the v3.0 of diffutils into a new branch, which we are to call "quote." We can use the command:
	git branch quote
It seems like git checkout -b quote also works. These commands cause us to switch to a new branch called "quote."

Then we start patching, using this command and getting results like these:
	patch < patch-3.0-patch.txt

patching file NEWS
patching file README
patching file TODO
patching file ms/config.bat
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n] y
patching file ms/config.site
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n] y
patching file po/en.po
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n] y
patching file tests/help-version
Reversed (or previously applied) patch detected!  Assume -R? [n] y

I then copied the patch details (that is, date, author, and files affected)
from the original quote-patch.txt into the ChangeLog-2008 file.

To commit changes to the quote branch, use:
	git commit -a

It takes effect after I type in a brief description of the change made into
the commit message. This allows me to generate the final formatted patch:
	git format-patch master --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

Finally, we just follow the instructions using git am (which applies a series
of patches via mailbox) and make check to build up the system in the
temporary branch. We can test it and see that it works as we intended.
