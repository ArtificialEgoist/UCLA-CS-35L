Q1. Brady's patch excluded "case_long_iso_time_style:" since the for-loop
containing the goto statement was removed as part of the patch as well. It
does not have to be removed, but can be messy and confusing for those reading
the code if left intact.

Q2. Doing a search on the function dcgettext shows that it tries to "translate
a text string into the user's native language." The parameter LC_TIME should
help pinpoint the corresponding language. As a result, this new version of
Coreutils should not pose a language problem as suggested. However, clean code
should still be a standard, and if any syntax changes in the future, the code
might have to change as well.

Q3. Input: /usr/local/cs/bin/python randline.py -n 3 /dev/null
Output: Traceback (most recent call last):
	File "randline.py", line 70, in <module>
	  main()

/dev/null is an empty file that contains 0 lines and will never save the lines
written to it. Thus when the script fetches a random line number, it gives an
error. There is no line that can be found!

Q4. Input: /usr/local/cs/bin/python3 randline.py -n 3 file

It seems that Python 2 allows exception parameters to be iterable. However, this is not good coding practice. Hence, Python 3 fixed this vagueness by forcing the statement to be explicit. It should be:
	except IOError as err:
