I tried running the command (ls -l /bin/bash), but the format was as it was supposed to be. However, I followed the steps for Brady's workaround in order to apply the patch anyway.

First, to fetch the compressed Coreutils 7.6 file, I used:
	wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz

I extracted it using:
	tar -xvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
Then I made a temporary directory for installation, coreutilsInstall:
	mkdir coreutilsInstall
To configure the installation into the correct folder:
	./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/nathant/coreutilsInstall
(According to the class, /home/nathant/coreutilsInstall also works)

After that, I used commands to compile it, then install it:
	make
	make install
(SEASnet servers give an 'error 2' when trying to use make install due
to some sort of restrictive permission)

In order to reproduce the error, we have to use locale-gen to change the
locales. The following commands update the locales that are available for use,
then changes the locale to the en_US.UTF-8:
	# locale-gen
	LOCALE="en_US.UTF-8"

To create the patch, we use cd src to get into the folder holding the ls file.
We type "patch," followed by right-clicking the terminal to copy the code from
the GNU archive. Then we press Enter and use CTRL+D twice to finish the patch.

This command chooses ls.c and applies the patch to it:
	patch -p3 < patch
Then we go into the main coreutils-7.6 folder and set up the patch
installation process:
	make clean
Lastly, we go into the coreutilsInstallation folder and use this command to
verify that the patch worked:
	./ls -l

To finally test our patched ls, we try it on both a new and old file:
	touch file1 (creates a new file)
	touch -t 9904181200 file2 (creates an 'old' file at 4/18, 1999)
Using ls -l on both of these files provides us with the correct Unix format,
as expected.

Here is the output from running the 'make' command in the source folder:

all-recursive is made in order to recursively check if more files need to be
conpiled. The make command compiles every directory related to coreutils,
including the lib and src folders (where the ls file is housed). Only source
files are relevant and therefore compiled.
